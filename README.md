## How to run

1. Make `run-java.sh` an executable

```sh
chmod +x run-java.sh
```

2. Check that you have docker running

```sh
docker -v
```

3. Run the App file

```sh
./run-java.sh App
```

## Features to add:

- [ ] Display dishes available at a restaurant and it's price
- [ ] Allow user to select multiple dishes
- [ ] Allow user to add address & phone number and place an order (Store it in-memory like we do with restuarants)
- [ ] Then take them to the beginning of the program where we display all orders (restaurant - dishes - placed at - delivery status) in the system and provide them an option to place a new order
